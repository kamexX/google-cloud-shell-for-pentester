# Explanation 
This Repository holds an install script with packages to set up the google cloud shell from a pentester perspective. For sure this will not be the holy grail to replace e.g. a kali notebook, but for most use cases this will be sufficient. You can connect to tryhackme or hackthebox via OpenVPN and start to practice a lot. 

Just give it a try and let your thoughts be in the commentary section.
